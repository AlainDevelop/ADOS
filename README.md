# Idea 1: Login.
So as ya'll know we've got a batch file for the login, but what is that for?;
  
  **1.** _You see a basic batch screen were it detects if you already have an existing account, since you've got new special text files of you account info whenever you create one, if you have em', you will procced to login (A), else, you will procced with creating an account (B)._
  
  **2.A.** _You see (again) a basic batch file screen where it says something like "enter your account username", when you have it, then it will delete the text on the screen and say something like "enter your account password", when you enter it, in the text file, it will search the username, and the password it has, if it doesnt find the username or password isn't the correct one, it will go back to step (1)._
  
  **2.B.** _You see (again) a basic batch file screen where it says something like "enter your new account username", when you write it, it will delete the text on the screen and say something like "enter your new account password", when you enter it, it will storage the data in a text file on your device, after that it will go back to step (1)._
